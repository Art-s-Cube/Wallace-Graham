                <h1>Wallace & Graham Gives</h1>
                <p>Wallace & Graham is comprised of over 60 attorneys and legal 
                    professionals rooted in three office buildings in the heart of 
                    downtown Salisbury in Rowan County. Since our inception in 1981, 
                    Wallace & Graham has been focused on charitable giving, particularly 
                    in the local Rowan County community.</p>
                <p>On April 24, 2020, Wallace & Graham, P.A. proudly launched a charitable 
                    giving effort, Wallace & Graham Gives, with an initial $10,000.00 donation 
                    to the Rowan County United Way COVID-19 Relief Fund. W&G Gives was launched 
                    to publicly show the firm's annual commitment to charitable giving and to 
                    allow our firm's employees to have an active stake and engagement in the process.</p>
                <p>W&G Gives Mission Statement: To explore issues impacting our community and 
                    to develop a responsive, meaningful giving program each year to promote 
                    enduring, sincere relationships between Wallace & Graham and the community
                     at large.</p>
